                <h1>Who we help</h1>
                <p>
                    We help coaches, consultants, course creators, agencies, and experts (basically, anybody who
                    sells advice). We only work with founders who are experts at their craft, with existing
                    businesses making at least $10,000 /month. These businesses have all the raw materials necessary
                    for 7-figure profits but they lack the structures, systems, teams, tools, and guidance on how to
                    get there.

                </p>
                <br>
                <h1>What do we do</h1>
                <p>We help these founders achieve “7-Figure Zen” — a business that makes $100k+ /month profit, with
                    1-2 products, 2-3 remote staff, happy clients, and a chill lifestyle. We do this through our two
                    training programs: <a href="https://go.consulting.com/wetube">Wetube</a> and <a
                        href="https://www.consulting.com/quantum">Quantum</a> . Our programs aim to
                    maximize: Profits, client results,
                    and founder happiness. Our programs aim to minimize: Complexity, costs, headcount, and stress.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h1>Our philosophy</h1>
                <p>"7-Figure Zen" is the perfect balance between profit, client results, and founder happiness. To
                    achieve this balance, we follow a philosophy built on six core principles:</p>
                <div class='column-box'>
                    <div><b>1. Results - </b> client results are the main thing.</div>
                    <div><b>2. Focus - </b> keep the main thing the main thing.</div>
                    <div><b>3. Simplicity - </b> do more with less.</div>
                    <div><b>4. Discipline - </b> freedom comes from discipline.</div>
                    <div><b>5. Quality - </b> make great things people cherish.</div>
                    <div><b>6. Joy - </b> if its not fun, you are doing it wrong.</div>
                </div>

                <br>
                <h1>Our story</h1>
                <p><b>Part 1. Solve a problem</b></p>
                <p>It all started back in 2011 when I (<a href="https://samovens.com" target='_blank'>Sam Ovens</a>) quit my
                    corporate job to start my
                    own business
                    from my parent's garage in New Zealand. I tried building multiple tech companies, but they
                    failed because nobody needed them. Knowing this, I decided to talk to business owners first and
                    ask them what their most painful problems were. They told me it was getting new customers. I
                    started learning everything I could about customer acquisition, and my consulting business was
                    born. </p>

                <p><b>Part 2. Services don't scale</b></p>
                <p>I helped local businesses get customers online with good websites, SEO, Adwords, Facebook Ads,
                    and an email list. My clients got results, I was making money, and it was easy for me to sign on
                    new clients — the problem was, I couldn’t handle any more work. I had reached the limits of my
                    energy and time. I hired a team to help me, and we became an “agency,” but it was hard to
                    deliver quality work, manage the complexity, and turn a decent profit. I realized services don’t
                    scale.</p>

                <p><b>Part 3. Course/coaching hybrid</b></p>
                <p>Doing the work for clients didn’t scale, so I thought: “What if I taught them how to do it
                    instead?”. I created an online course that showed people how to do the things I did for them so
                    they could get customers for themselves. The content alone wasn’t enough; I had to provide group
                    coaching and support to keep them motivated and troubleshoot their issues. The new model was a
                    success; I scaled my consulting business to $300,000 /month, by myself, from home, with 80%
                    margins.</p>

                <p><b>Part 4. Too much scale</b></p>
                <p>Eager to see how far I could push things, I hired a team, and we started scaling aggressively.
                    Within 1-year, we were making $18m /year, and by year-2, we were making $36m /year. I featured
                    on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list; we had a fancy NYC office, 45 staff, and spent $40k /day on ads.
                    People started noticing me on the streets. I was semi-famous. But beneath the surface, things
                    were chaotic, profit margins suffered, I didn’t know my clients, and I started to hate my life.
                </p>

                <p><b>Part 5. Finding zen</b></p>
                <p>Tired of putting out endless fires and working 18-hour days, my wife and I moved to LA,
                    California, and I started simplifying my Frankenstein of a business. The idea was simple: More
                    with less. We aimed to maximize: profits, client results, and founder happiness — while
                    simultaneously — minimizing: complexity, costs, headcount, and stress. After two years of
                    experimentation, we found what we believe is the perfect model. We call it “7-Figure Zen”, we
                    live it, and we teach it too.</p>
